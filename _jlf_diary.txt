Added new makefiles to build with Builder
    Macos, Linux:
        cd src
        make -f GNUmakefile-builder configure   # (to clean the build and to create the rights symbolic links)
        make -f GNUmakefile-builder
    Windows:
        cd src
        nmake /f Makefile-builder.vc configure  & rem (to clean the build and to create the rights symbolic links)
        nmake /f Makefile-builder.vc

The binaries are generated in the folder build, the dynamic libraries are in github for these configurations:
    build/macos/clang/debug/64
    build/macos/clang/release/64
    build/ubuntu/gcc/debug/64
    build/ubuntu/gcc/release/64
    build/win/cl/debug/64
    build/win/cl/release/64


Added support for 64-bit.

Added support for type aliases.
Each alias defines a type and a size, no size accepted after these aliases.

- long (signed long)
- llong (signed long long)
- pointer (opaque, no dereferencement, unlike GCI_indirect)
- size_t (unsigned)
- ssize_t (signed)
- ulong (unsigned long)
- ullong (unsigned long long)

The file gci-try.rexx has been updated to support MacOs.

The demo with statvfs in gci-try.rexx has been documented to bring all the
details about the types used in the structure.
This function is a good illustration of the need of type aliases in GCI.

The structure statvfs64 depends on the bitness.
Since the rexx interpreters do not provide a portable way to test their bitness, a new function has been added to GCI:
    GciBitness
which returns 32 or 64.
